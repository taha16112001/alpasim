# Alpasim Controller

This directory contains the Alpasim controller, which models vehicle dynamics and control.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command from the project directory
(`<repo_root>/src/controller`):

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Implementation Notes

The controller receives trajectory reference commands, which are possibly delayed, along with state
information from the vehicle, which is used to constrain to the road surface. This information is
forwarded by a `SystemManager` to a `System` (vehicle dynamics + controller) which uses an MPC to
compute commanded steering and acceleration for the vehicle model, which then propagates the
dynamics to the requested time and returns the new state.

[do_mpc](https://www.do-mpc.com/) is used for the MPC implementation, and the vehicle model is
implemented in both a symbolic representation (using `casadi` as required by `do_mpc`) and a
non-symbolic implementation of the (mostly) same dynamics. The equations of motion can be found in
e.g. _Vehicle Dynamics and Control_ by Rajamani, with minor deviations to support the rear-axis
coordinate system definition. To avoid singularities at low speed, a kinematic model is used below a
speed threshold.

As the vehicle dynamics assume planar motion, additional frame constructions/transformations are
required. Namely, the controller/vehicle model introduces what is referred to as the
`inertial frame`: a temporary reference frame that is coincident/aligned with the vehicle `rig`
frame at some time step. This frame allows for relative (planar) motion to be computed and then
added to the `local` to `rig` transformation.

The MPC and vehicle model assume a lateral/longitudinal decoupled system with state:

- `x_inertial`: x position of the rig origin relative to the inertial frame,
- `y_inertial`: y position of the rig origin relative to the inertial frame,
- `yaw_inertial`: yaw angle of the rig origin relative to the inertial frame,
- `body x-vel`: x component of the cg velocity (relative to inertial frame), resolved in the rig
  frame,
- `body y-vel`: y component of the cg velocity (relative to inertial frame), resolved in the rig
  frame,
- `yaw rate`: yaw rate of the rig in the rig frame,
- `steering_angle`: steering angle of the front wheel,
- `acceleration`: time derivative of the longitudinal velocity

For each time step, the system will:

- Override the current vehicle state (`local` to `rig` transformation and optionally the velocities)
- "Drop" a new reference frame whose origin is coincident/aligned with the vehicle
- Reset the initial state of the MPC based on the current vehicle state
- Run the MPC to compute the commanded steering and acceleration
- Propagate the vehicle model to the requested time using the commanded steering and acceleration to
  determine the relative motion of the vehicle
- Apply the relative motion to the `local` to `rig` transformation

### MPC Penalty Design

The MPC uses a quadratic penalty on the longitudinal position error, lateral position error, heading
error, and acceleration, as well as regularization terms on the relative changes of steering angle
commands and acceleration commands. The time horizon for the controller is 2 sec (20 steps at 0.1s),
and there is a term that specifies at which index along the horizon costs should start accumulating
(to avoid over-penalizing initial transients).

$$
J = \sum_{i=i_0}^{N} (w_{lon} e_{lon,i}^2 + w_{lat} e_{lat,i}^2 + w_{head} e_{head,i}^2 + w_{accel} a_i^2) + \sum_{i=1}^{N} (w_{\Delta steer} \Delta \delta_i^2 + w_{\Delta accel} \Delta a_i^2)
$$
