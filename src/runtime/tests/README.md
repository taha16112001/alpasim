# Testing

Tests should be written in the `tests` directory. The test files should be named `test_<module>.py`
where `<module>` is the name of the module being tested. Tests should be written for all public
functions and classes in the module, aside from trivial data classes.

## Running Tests

A prerequisite for running the tests is to have a suitable environment and the `pytest` package
installed. Given that this project is expected to be run inside a docker container, this is used as
a basis for the proposed configuration.

Note that the following instructions assume you are running from the src/runtime directory.

With `uv`:

```bash
cd src/runtime
uv sync --all-extras  # This installs dev dependencies including pytest
```

And then, to run:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
