# Replay Services

Services for replaying recorded simulation data in Alpasim. Primary use case at the moment is the
`test_runtime_integration_replay.py` test which checks that the runtime sends the same requests as
in the logs. This is helpful to make sure nothing changed after refactoring. **Note that this test
is manual as we don't want to burden developers to update the recorded ASL logs every time they make
an intentional change to runtime**

## Components

- **ASLReplay**: Replays ASL (Alpasim Scene Language) files containing actor trajectories and scene
  data
- **ReplayServiceBase**: Base class for implementing custom replay services

## Generating replay files

To generate the needed files to be replayed, run, from src/wizard:

```
RUN_DIR=/home/migl/workspace/alpasim/.wizard \
uv run python -m alpasim_wizard \
    wizard.log_dir=${RUN_DIR} \
    +deploy=local \
    runtime.endpoints.trafficsim.skip=False \
    scenes.scene_ids="[clipgt-c14c031a-8c17-4d08-aa4d-23c020a6871e]" \
    runtime.default_scenario_parameters.n_sim_steps=60
```

And copy the asl log, network-config and user-config files to src/runtime/tests/data/integration.

## Changing the scene

If you change the scene_id, make sure to also add the updated usdz file to the folder - it's
recommended to modify the contents of the usdz file and remove all the large rendering artifacts we
don't need. You can zip it back up with (from within the unziped usdz folder)

```
zip -r -0 6ea1c7a3-98b7-4adc-b774-4d9526371a0b.usdz ./*
```

To upload it to git, use `git lfs track "path/to/file.(usdz|asl)"`
