# Alpasim Data
This directory contains subdirectories which we will need to mount in the various docker containers to run alpasim.

1. `nre-artifacts`
    * Contains the `.usdz` files which are scene reconstructions for neural rendering with NRE
    * Also used by the runtime to obtain ground truth vehicle trajectories and physics for access to scene meshes
2. `trafficsim` (To be released at a later date)
    * Contains scene road maps and configuration for the traffic simulator
