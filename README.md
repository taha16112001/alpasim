## 🌟 What is AlpaSim?

AlpaSim is an open-source simulator for autonomous vehicles. It helps researchers and developers test their driving algorithms in realistic scenarios. With AlpaSim, you can simulate sensor data, vehicle movements, and traffic situations. This platform is modular and easy to expand, making it suitable for various research needs.

### Suitable Use Cases:

- **Algorithm Validation**: Test your autonomous driving algorithms in a safe, controlled environment.
- **Safety Analysis**: Explore how vehicles behave in challenging situations or edge cases.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare different models and configurations to determine the best options.
- **Debugging**: Identify and resolve complex behaviors in autonomous driving systems.

### 🛠️ Sensor Fidelity

AlpaSim offers advanced features for realistic simulations. It includes Neural Rendering (NuRec) to generate photorealistic sensor images. This capability ensures that your tests closely mirror real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Getting Started
